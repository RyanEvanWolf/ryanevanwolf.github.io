<h3>Environment Setup</h3>
<p>I like to use terminator on my devices.
  It gives me lots of great options like spltting a single screen into many tabs,
  something really essential when you have heavy command line based work.</p>

<p>A small annoyance that kept on creeping up is that even if you set terminator
  as your <i>Terminator</i>, the right click nautilus menu will continue to use the default bash terminal.
  This doesn't seem so bad, but I've grown heavy reliance on this as the bridge between the GUI and terminal
  worlds. Right clicking and opening a terminal in the same location as the place it was clicked makes
  life drastically easier with many seperate projects and shell environments.

  I found a forum post discussing this which came up with a solution that looked like this.
  add the FileManagerACtions tool and add a custom  <command>

function openCity(evt, cityName) {
  var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
  tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");
  for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
    tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
  }
  tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablinks");
  for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
    tablinks[i].className = tablinks[i].className.replace(" active", "");
  }
  document.getElementById(cityName).style.display = "block";
  evt.currentTarget.className += " active";
}

<p>I like to use terminator emulator on my devices.
  It gives me useful functionalities like splitting a single screen into many tabs,
  something essential when you have heavy command line based work.</p>

<p>A small annoyance that kept on creeping up is that even if you set terminator
  as your default terminal, the right click nautilus menu will continue to use the default bash terminal.
  It's drastically quicker to navigate through folders in Nautilus, and then open terminals in the correct working directory
  as needed.</p>

  I found a forum post discussing this which came up with a solution that looked like this.
  add the FileManagerACtions tool and add a custom  <command>
